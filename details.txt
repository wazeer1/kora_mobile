A global version of this platform can be positioned as a “ranked ladder for live, refereed debates” that sits somewhere between Clubhouse/Twitter Spaces and competitive debate tools like Kialo/Prepd, but optimized for live, gamified argumentation rather than free-form conversation or static threads. It should focus on asynchronous growth (clippable content) plus synchronous “match days”, and on helping users measurably improve argumentation via analytics and AI coaching similar to emerging argumentation-learning systems. Monetization can primarily come from premium analytics and ticketed events, with microtransactions like “Golden Mic” as secondary.
​

Below is a worldwide, non-Kerala-specific platform plan, mapped to your feature catalog and expanded into a product/strategy document.

1) Executive summary
Pitch: A global social platform where debates run like esports matches—structured rounds, referees, rankings, and AI stats—so that better arguments, not louder voices, win.

Persona: “Competitive Thinker” (18–34), a student, creator, or knowledge worker who already enjoys podcasts, debates, and Twitter/X threads and wants a serious but fun arena for structured discourse.

Monetization: Freemium model: free debates and viewing; subscription-based Pro Analytics for debaters plus ticketed live events and microtransactions (Golden Mic queue-jumps).

2) Problem & opportunity
Existing social platforms (X/Spaces, Clubhouse, Discord Stages) are optimized for virality and casual conversation, not structured reasoning; they lack persistent ratings, rules, or analytical feedback to reward good argumentation.
​

Debate- and argumentation-focused tools (Kialo, wribate, education platforms) tend to be text-based or classroom-oriented and do not provide esport-like, live, spectator-friendly experiences with rich analytics.
​

There is rising global demand for online learning and communication-skill improvement (online learning growing ~9% annually), creating a large market for platforms that teach critical thinking and argumentation as a durable skill.
​

6) Architecture & tech stack
Recommended stack
Frontend

Web (React/Next.js) for primary interface; React Native for mobile apps.

WebRTC for real-time audio/video.

Backend

Node.js/TypeScript or Go microservices (auth, match-making, streaming control).

GraphQL or REST API for client communication.

Infra

Cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure) with Kubernetes for scaling real-time services.

Global CDNs for assets and edge nodes close to user clusters.

Data & storage

PostgreSQL for relational data (users, events, payments).

Redis for low-latency state (rooms, queues, presence).

Object storage (S3-equivalent) for recordings and assets.

Real-time & media

Managed WebRTC/SFU (e.g., LiveKit, Agora, Twilio Live) to avoid building media infra from scratch.
​

Payments

Stripe, Apple/Google IAP, PayPal; expand regionally as needed.

Third-party services

Analytics: Mixpanel/Amplitude + in-house event pipeline.

AI: OpenAI/Anthropic or similar for summarization, fallacy spotting prototypes.

Auth: OAuth with Google, Apple, X/Twitter, Discord.

Non-functional considerations
Offline tolerance: Limited; core experience is live; allow offline viewing of downloaded replays.

Localization: Architecture should support multiple languages (copy, prompts, right-to-left layouts) from the start.

Scaling: SFU-based architecture scales better than mesh; start with 100–1,000 concurrent users per room targets.

Cost bands (very rough monthly)

Low: Prototype with 5–10K MAU, few live events — ~US$2–5K (managed WebRTC + core infra).

Medium: 50–100K MAU, regular events — ~US$15–30K.

High: 1M+ MAU, frequent large events — US$100K+ including bandwidth and AI compute.

7) Monetization & unit economics
Revenue streams (at least 3)
Premium Analytics Subscription

For debaters, creators, and trainers.

Monthly fee gives detailed performance dashboards, audience breakdowns, and AI feedback.

Ticketed Events / Pay-per-view

Celebrity debates, masterclass series.

Revenue share with hosts/organizations.

Golden Mic & Microtransactions

Priority Q&A queue, special badges, visual effects.

B2B / Institutional Licenses

White-label or classroom-focused packages for schools, universities, and training firms, similar to B2B debate platforms.
​

Simple 3-year unit economics example (illustrative)
Assumptions

Average CAC (consumer side): US$8 (paid + organic blended).

ARPU (all users blended): US$3/month across paying and non-paying users by Year 3.

Paying conversion: 10% at US$15/month; others monetized via tickets/microtransactions.

Churn: 4% monthly for paying users (≈2-year average lifetime).

LTV (paying user)

Contribution margin per paying user ≈ US$10/month (after variable costs).

Average lifetime ≈ 24 months → LTV ≈ US$240.

LTV (blended)

Effective LTV per acquired user ≈ US$40–60 (mix of non-paying and paying participants).

Break-even scenarios

If CAC = US$8 and LTV = US$48, LTV:CAC = 6:1.

With 100K acquired users → ~US$4.8M in projected long-term gross margin versus US$0.8M spent on acquisition (excluding fixed costs).

Breakeven on operating costs depends on burn (e.g., a US$300–500K/year burn could break even at ~50–80K MAU at target ARPU).

8) Go-to-market & partnerships (global-adaptable)
Acquisition channels
Student and debate ecosystems

University debate societies, MUN organizers, online education communities.

Creators & public intellectuals

Podcasters, YouTube commentators, Substack writers seeking higher-signal discourse.

Existing social audio & communities

Discord servers, X/Spaces hosts, Clubhouse-like communities that want more structure.

9) Compliance & risks
Payments & financial compliance

Use established PSPs and app-store billing; comply with local KYC/AML where payouts to creators are involved.

Data privacy

GDPR/CCPA-compliant policies; explicit consent for recording, analytics, and AI-derived insights; transparent retention windows.

Content moderation

Risk of harassment, misinformation, hate speech.

Policies + enforcement tools: gavel mute, penalty box, reporting, and human review.

Child safety

Clear age restrictions; safeguards for under-18 users in public debates.

AI bias & explainability

AI referee metrics should be advisory, not deterministic; provide explanations and allow dispute review.

Mitigation: layered moderation (host tools + platform policies + community reporting), transparent AI disclaimers, careful rollout of fallacy detection as “assistance,” not arbitration.

10) 8-week validation plan (6 experiments)
Each experiment is global, lightweight, and focused on de-risking core assumptions.

13) Ask & pitch templates
Short email pitch to an accelerator/incubator
Subject: Building the “esports arena” for global debates

Hi [Name],

We’re building a live debate platform that runs like esports: structured rounds, referees, AI stats, and rankings—so better arguments, not louder voices, win.

Early pilots show strong engagement when debates are scored and replayable.

The platform targets students, creators, and trainers who already use Discord, X Spaces, and YouTube for discourse.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call to explore fit with your program?

Merchant/creator outreach (WhatsApp + in-person style)
WhatsApp:

Hey [Name], this is [Your Name]—I’ve been following your debates on [platform].

We’ve built a live debate arena where you can host structured 1v1 or panel debates with:

Timed rounds, audience sentiment graphs, and replays.

Optional ticketing and “Golden Mic” Q&A so you get paid for high-signal conversations.

Would you like to try a pilot event next month? We’ll handle setup, mod tools, and post-event clips.

In-person (short script):

“Imagine your regular debate show, but with esports-style structure: timers, AI stats, rankings, and paid queue-jump for audience Q&A. We run the tech; you bring the ideas and audience. Want to co-host a pilot?”

Seed investor one-liner + traction ask
One-liner: “Building the global ranked arena for live debates—like Twitch + chess.com, but for arguments instead of games.”

Traction ask: “We’re raising a US$[X] seed to grow from [current users/events] to [target] and to productize our AI referee and monetization stack for creators and trainers.”
